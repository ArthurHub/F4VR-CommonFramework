// Mods Config FO4 VR's native API, for the DLL of a mod that has a config spec, or a config UI of its own.
// Copy this whole file into your project AS IS.
//
// Two layers. What passes between the DLLs is two interfaces of virtual functions: ModsConfigFO4ApiV1, which Mods
// Config VR implements, and IClient, which a client implements and registers once. The menu asks the client by name
// for its functions, states and options. Their arguments are plain: whole numbers, float, bool, enums, UTF-8 texts
// that end with a zero, and pointers. No std:: type crosses: each DLL has its own heap, and its own layout of them.
// What the host passes is valid during the call, so copy what you keep. What you pass the host copies before the
// call returns.
// ModsConfigFO4Client, at the end of this file, is an IClient over your lambdas, compiled into your DLL. Use it, and
// the interfaces only for what it does not wrap. Every call, either way, is on the game's main thread.
//
// A client method that throws or faults cuts the client off until the game is restarted, and its mod works as one
// with no client.
//
// EXAMPLE USAGE:
//
// {
//     using namespace mods_config::api;
//     auto& modsConfig = ModsConfigFO4Client::get();
//
//     // at any time, also before it connects
//     modsConfig.addFunction("calibrate", [](const Params& params) {
//         return FunctionResult{ .done = true, .message = std::format("Done: {:.2f} m.", measure(params.getInt("samples", 10))) };
//     });
//     modsConfig.addState("calibrating", [] { return std::optional<Value>(isCalibrating()); });
//     modsConfig.subscribeToChanges([](const Change& change) { previewOrRestore(change.path, change.value, change.discard); });
//     modsConfig.subscribeToSaves([](const Saved&) { endPreviewsAndReload(); });
//
//     // from F4SE's kPostLoad on, when every plugin's DLL is loaded: 0 while Mods Config FO4 VR is there
//     const int err = modsConfig.connect("MyMod");
// }
